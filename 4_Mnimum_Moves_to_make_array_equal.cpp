/*
APPROACH-3: Using the stl function: 'nth_element()':
T.C = O(n) + O(n/2);
S.C = (1);

ABOUT THE FUNCTION: 'nth_element':
The std::nth_element() function in C++ STL is used to partially sort a range of elements,
such that the element at the nth position is the one that would be in that position in a fully sorted sequence.
All elements before the nth position are less than or equal to the element at n,
and all elements after the nth position are greater than or equal to the element at n.
However, the order of elements before and after the nth position is undefined.

SYNTAX: 
nth_element(RandomAccessIterator first, RandomAccessIterator nth, RandomAccessIterator last);
nth_element(RandomAccessIterator first, RandomAccessIterator nth, RandomAccessIterator last, Compare comp);
where,
-> first: Iterator to the beginning of the range.
-> nth: Iterator pointing to the nth element in the range.
-> last: Iterator to the end of the range.
-> comp: A comparison function or lambda for custom sorting (optional).

TIME COMPLEXITY:
Average Case: O(n), where n = (lastâˆ’first), Achieved using a variant of the Quickselect algorithm (based on partitioning).
Worst Case: O(n^2)

SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(1), as it operates in-place.
